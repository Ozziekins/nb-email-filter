Hello champions,

Do not use any external libraries to read CSV files (like this one)

There is a nice requirement: Create FileManager class. Write all methods using pure Java (that you learned so far).

Try to complete "reading data from CSV files" part as soon as possible. It will take more time than you think.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.



Stay disciplined,

AK.
