Dear Stuart:

I appreciate the e-mail concerning the Board of Trustees for The Institute
for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre. You do indeed have a very impressive
board.

I am still thinking about the possibility of serving on your board. But at
the earliest, it would be late this year before I could entertain any
involvement. With your indulgence, I will keep you advised.

Warm regards,

Ken
