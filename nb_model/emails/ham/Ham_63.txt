Hi Mr. Grady -

I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia,
and he said that is great for you to attend. In addition, I did talk to Ken
and he said "absolutely", so please plan on it.

Ken and Linda will arrive in Philadelphia tomorrow night.

See you in September.

Rosalee
