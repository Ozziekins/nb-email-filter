Dear Ken,

Although I didn't have your response in hand, based on the responses I have
received, it seems that the best time for our next meeting is 3:00 - 5:30
p.m. on July 12 in New York City.

I do hope you will be able to make it. Please let me know.

In any event, I'll be in touch with you soon to follow up on the first
meeting.

Best regards,
Jeff
