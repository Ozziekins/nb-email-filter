Week 05: Friday session
Dear students,


Apparently I was overoptimistic about recovering soon. So, our Friday session will also be online this week, and you will not need to be in the classroom for joining the session. Meanwhile, please kindly note the attendance requirements for the online sessions mentioned in our syllabus.
