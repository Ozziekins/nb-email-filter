Dear Students,

An optional midterm assignment is uploaded (see BB, Assignments). If you submit this assignment it will be counted as 50% of your midterm exam grade.

So,  this assignment contributes to the course grade as 15%.

If you do not submit it, your midterm exam grade will not be changed.

Best regards,

Vugar M.
